 Single Inheritance:
In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. In the image below, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B.
      class A
            class B extends A    then this is known as Single Inheritance

 Multilevel Inheritance:
 In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as the derived class also act as the base class to other class. In the below image, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B, which in turn serves as a base class for the derived class C. In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparent’s members.

    class A
            class B extend A
                            class C extends B

                      this is known as Multilevel Inheritance


 Hierarchical Inheritance:
In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one subclass. In the below image, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B, C and D.

    class A

    class B extends A       class B extends A      class C extends A

        this is known as Hierarchical Inheritance


Multiple Inheritance ( through Interface )
In Multiple inheritances, one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes. Please note that Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. In java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces. In the image below, Class C is derived from interface A and B.

    class A             interface B

    class c extends A , B

    this is known as Multiple Inheritance



 Hybrid Inheritance(Through Interfaces):
 It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. Since java doesn’t support multiple inheritances with classes, hybrid inheritance is also not possible with classes. In java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces.
