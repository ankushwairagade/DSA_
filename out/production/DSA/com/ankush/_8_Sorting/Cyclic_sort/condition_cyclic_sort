when cyclic sort is used ?

array is given in the form of N
         0 1 2 3 4
example {2,5,4,3,1}
now you can see element is ( 0 - N-1)
 just applying cyclic sort


 this topic * OP

 Amazon , google ,.... so on
 but no facebook



 // rule
     check range  [0,n-1]
        then correctindex = arr[i]
     check rande [1,N]
           then correctindex =arr[i]-1;
