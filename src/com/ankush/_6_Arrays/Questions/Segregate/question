Segregate 0s and 1s in an array

You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array [Basically you have to sort the array]. Traverse array only once.

Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Approach  both take T(n) = 0(n) , S(n) = 0(1)

1.  Method 1 (Count 0s or 1s)
2.  Method 2 (Use two indexes to traverse)



support you want to segregat array in some condition then use the


    lets take example ,
    you want to segregate even and odd
    then ,  %2 method
            or bitwise method to segregate the array
