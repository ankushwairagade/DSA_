TYPE OF LANGUAGES
1. Procedural
2. Functional
3. Object Oriented


python supports all types (procedural,functional and oo)
but java supports (functional and oo )


Static vs Dynamic Languages

static mean
int a = 10;
Type checking at compile Time
More control


dynamic mean
a =10;
a ="hellooo"
Type checking at runtime


Memory Management

a = 10

a is reference Object and 10 is Object

two memo (heap and stack)

heap ds where actual objects is stored  like 10 is stored in heap mem
Stack ds where memory reference is stored like a is stored in stack mem


Garbage Collection

it run automatically by JVM,
it will destroy the object which don;t have any kind of references available..



Java Architecture

take java files (src files)  --> compiler into class files  --> this .class files need jvm to run (JRE) ---> machine code
